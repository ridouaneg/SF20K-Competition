  The <strong>Short-Films 20K (SF20K) Competition</strong> aims to advance story-level video understanding 
  by leveraging the new SF20K dataset[1]. While recent multimodal models have demonstrated 
  progress in video understanding, existing benchmarks are largely limited to short videos with simple narratives. In contrast, 
  our competition focuses on complex, long-term reasoning in storytelling by introducing multiple-choice and open-ended 
  question answering tasks.
</p>

<!-- <p>
  The SF20K dataset is the largest publicly available movie dataset, composed of 20,143 amateur films. It offers long-term 
  video tasks in the form of multiple-choice and open-ended question answering. Our extensive analysis of SF20K reveals 
  minimal data leakage, emphasizes the need for long-term reasoning, and demonstrates the strong performance of recent VLMs.

<h5>Dataset</h5>

<p>
  The competition is based on <strong>SF20K</strong>[1], a large-scale, publicly available dataset of 
  20,143 short films, amounting to 3,684 hours of video content. Each film is self-contained, lasting 5 to 40 minutes 
  (average 11 minutes), and spans a variety of genres. SF20K includes automatically generated and manually curated 
  question-answer (QA) pairs.
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>SF20K-Train:</strong> 19,071 movies with 191,007 automatically generated QA pairs, provided for model training.</li>
    <li><strong>SF20K-Test-Expert (public):</strong> 50 movies with 500 QA pairs, used for validation and leaderboard ranking.</li>
    <li><strong>SF20K-Test-Expert (private):</strong> 50 movies with 500 QA pairs, used for final ranking.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  The dataset is available on <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/rghermi/sf20k">Hugging Face</a>, with additional annotations (shot boundaries, subtitles, face tracks) on <a href="https://github.com/ridouaneg/sf20k">GitHub</a>. Videos are hosted on YouTube and Vimeo, URLs are provided.
</p>
